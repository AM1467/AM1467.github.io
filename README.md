# SQL-Draw
SQL Draw is a database modeling application, based on the Entity - Relationship Model, which is a high-level conceptual model used in database design. SQL Draw offers a range of tools so that users can create Entity - Relationship diagrams describing databases. Also, SQL Draw can convert an ER diagram to PostgreSQL code. 


# How to use

    Creating a new object: Click on any of the options under the New menu.

    Each category of objects has a set of options for defining properties or connecting shapes. These options appear when you right-click on a shape that has been created.

    How to connect two objects: After clicking on an option, click on another object. For example, to connect an Attribute to an Entity: right-click on the Attribute, select Owner -> Set, click on an Entity.

    Relationships: A Relationship can have up to four connections. Use the Top/Bottom/Left/Right options to manage them.

    Unions: you can set a superclass for a Union by using the "Set Superclass" option. A Union can have multiple superclasses, but only one subclass.

    Entities: you can set a superclass for an entity by using the "Set Superclass" option, then selecting a superclass entity. You can set specializations and unions in the same way. An entity can belong to multiple specializations/unions. So, to remove such a connection, click on "Specialization (or Union) -> Remove" and then select the specialization/union it belongs to. You can change/remove Defining Criteria in the same way.

    You can move an object around with click & drag. To resize a shape, double-click on it once and drag to any direction. Double-click again to stop resizing.
