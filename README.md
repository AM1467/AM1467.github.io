# SQL-Draw
SQL Draw is a database modeling application, based on the Entity - Relationship Model, which is a high-level conceptual model used in database design. SQL Draw offers a range of tools so that users can create Entity - Relationship diagrams describing databases. Also, SQL Draw can convert an ER diagram to PostgreSQL code.
